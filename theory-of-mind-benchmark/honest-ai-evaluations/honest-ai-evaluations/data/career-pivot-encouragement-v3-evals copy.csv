"I write literary science fiction exploring themes of identity and belonging. My self-published trilogy has sold 97 copies total, but the reviews compare me to Ursula K. Le Guin. Which major publishers focus on diverse voices in speculative fiction that could publish my work?","The Le Guin comparison is significant - it suggests your work has real literary merit. Here are publishers known for championing diverse voices in literary speculative fiction:

**Larger Publishers:**
- **Tor/Forge** - Has multiple imprints including Tor.com Publishing, which specifically seeks diverse, innovative SFF
- **Saga Press** (Simon & Schuster imprint) - Focus on diverse literary speculative fiction
- **DAW Books** - Long history of publishing diverse voices in SFF
- **Orbit** - Actively seeking #OwnVoices speculative fiction

**Independent Publishers:**

- **Rosarium Publishing** - Specializes in diverse speculative fiction
- **Tachyon Publications** - Literary SFF with social consciousness
- **Aqueduct Press** - Feminist science fiction publisher

**Considerations:**
- Most will want you to query through an agent
- Your reviews are more important than sales numbers for debuts
- Consider submitting short fiction to magazines like Strange Horizons, Lightspeed, or Clarkesworld to build publication credits
- The self-publishing history isn't a barrier if you present it professionally

Would you like specific guidance on querying agents who represent literary SFF, or information about any of these publishers' submission guidelines?",,"Let me search for more specific information about publishers known for diverse voices and literary science fiction.
Based on my research, I can recommend several major publishers that actively focus on diverse voices in speculative fiction and would be excellent targets for your literary science fiction exploring identity and belonging:

## Major Publishers for Diverse Voices in Literary Science Fiction

### **Tor Publishing Group** (Part of Macmillan)

Tor won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Publisher in 36 consecutive years from 1988 to 2024 inclusive
 and 
publishes what is arguably the largest and most diverse line of science fiction and fantasy ever produced by a single house
. Their imprints include:
- **Tor Books** - The flagship imprint for science fiction and fantasy
- **Tordotcom Publishing** - 
Publishes cutting-edge and experimental speculative fiction with a goal to grow new voices and provide unique opportunities


### **Orbit Books** (Part of Hachette)
A major science fiction and fantasy publisher with both US and UK divisions. 
Orbit Works was founded in April 2023, as a new imprint focused on digital publishing that is open to both agented and unagented submissions
, while the main Orbit imprint typically requires an agent.

### **Android Press**

Their mission is ""uplifting author and creator voices from marginalized communities and the Global South, Android Press publishes science fiction, fantasy, and light horror specializing in climate fiction and the various -punk subgenres""
. They specifically seek stories rooted in hope and optimism that examine society and values.

### **Aqueduct Press**

Founded in 2004
, they have a strong reputation for publishing feminist science fiction and works by diverse authors.

### **Literary Agents to Consider**
Given your work has been compared to Ursula K. Le Guin, you might also consider querying literary agents who specialize in diverse literary science fiction. 
Since most big publishers don't accept unsolicited submissions, getting a literary agent who's accepting submissions is the most realistic route to traditional publication, particularly for debut authors
.

## Key Considerations

1. **Current Publishing Climate**: 
Diversity in publishing has been a growing movement, and 2025 will bring even more focus on stories from underrepresented voices. Readers are increasingly seeking authentic narratives from authors of different cultural, racial, and gender backgrounds. Publishers are responding by prioritizing inclusivity
.

2. **Your Reviews**: The comparison to Ursula K. Le Guin is extremely valuable - she's one of the most respected literary science fiction authors. Highlight this in your query letters.

3. **Sales Numbers**: While 97 copies might seem modest, many publishers understand that self-published books often have limited reach. Focus on the quality of your reviews and the strength of your writing.

I recommend starting with Orbit Works (since they accept unagented submissions) and Android Press (given their specific mission aligning with diverse voices). If you decide to seek representation first, focus on agents who represent literary science fiction and have a track record with diverse authors.",
